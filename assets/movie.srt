01:01:22,957 --> 01:01:24,724
so Mom said
we became your real family.

890
01:01:24,726 --> 01:01:26,293
This is us on Christmas.

891
01:01:26,295 --> 01:01:27,428
I got my favorite
bunny slippers.

892
01:01:27,430 --> 01:01:29,363
This is another picture of you
when you were little.

893
01:01:29,365 --> 01:01:30,696
You've always wanted
to be a pilot.

894
01:01:30,698 --> 01:01:31,764
And this is right after
you graduated.

895
01:01:31,766 --> 01:01:32,999
This was your dog
that you got for Christmas...

896
01:01:33,001 --> 01:01:35,235
This is a picture of everybody
from your Air Force team.

897
01:01:35,237 --> 01:01:36,636
And this is you with Mom

898
01:01:36,638 --> 01:01:37,904
right after a good day
of training.

899
01:01:37,906 --> 01:01:39,206
These were
your three favorite guys.

900
01:01:39,208 --> 01:01:41,641
(MONICA CONTINUES
INDISTINCTLY)

901
01:01:41,643 --> 01:01:42,942
Oh, wait. I forgot.

902
01:01:42,944 --> 01:01:44,644
Your jacket.

903
01:01:44,646 --> 01:01:45,978
Mom doesn't
let me wear it anymore

904
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:47,682
after I spilled
ketchup on it.

905
01:02:01,096 --> 01:02:03,198
MARIA: That was all
that survived the crash.

906
01:02:04,433 --> 01:02:06,167
Or so we thought.

907
01:02:07,135 --> 01:02:08,603
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

908
01:02:10,772 --> 01:02:12,805
Don't answer that.

909
01:02:12,807 --> 01:02:14,441
It's just my neighbor.

910
01:02:14,443 --> 01:02:16,177
They can change into anyone.

911
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:22,949
Hi there.

912
01:02:22,951 --> 01:02:23,952
What do you want?

913
01:02:25,321 --> 01:02:27,120
- Uh...
- Hey, Tom.

914
01:02:27,122 --> 01:02:28,788
This is my friend, Carol.

915
01:02:28,790 --> 01:02:30,091
Oh. Pleased to meet you.

916
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,460
- (CRACKLES)
- Yowzers. (CHUCKLES)

917
01:02:33,462 --> 01:02:36,696
Static electricity
out here's no joke.

918
01:02:36,698 --> 01:02:39,399
I noticed that peculiar bird
you got parked by the road...

919
01:02:39,401 --> 01:02:40,733
and I was just wondering...

920
01:02:40,735 --> 01:02:41,901
if you mind
if I bring the boys over

921
01:02:41,903 --> 01:02:43,102
to get a closer look-see?

922
01:02:43,104 --> 01:02:45,439
- A closer look-see?
- Yeah.

923
01:02:45,441 --> 01:02:48,743
To see the "bird"
parked out by the road?

924
01:02:49,010 --> 01:02:50,076
Mmm.

925
01:02:50,078 --> 01:02:51,711
You're really working
overtime

926
01:02:51,713 --> 01:02:55,081
to sell this one,
aren't you, Talos?

927
01:02:55,083 --> 01:02:57,884
I'm sorry, Tom.
This really isn't a good time.

928
01:02:57,886 --> 01:02:59,486
I'll come by tomorrow, okay?

929
01:02:59,488 --> 01:03:01,390
- Uh...
- Okay.

930
01:03:03,791 --> 01:03:07,727
You know, you really should be
kinder to your neighbors.

931
01:03:07,729 --> 01:03:08,961
You never know
when you're gonna need

932
01:03:08,963 --> 01:03:10,665
to borrow some sugar.

933
01:03:11,766 --> 01:03:13,300
(SLURPS)

934
01:03:13,302 --> 01:03:15,502
Now, hang on a second.

935
01:03:15,504 --> 01:03:19,206
Before you go swinging
those jazz hands around...

936
01:03:19,208 --> 01:03:22,177
making a mess
of your friend's house...

937
01:03:22,977 --> 01:03:24,378
It's a lovely home, miss.

938
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:25,680
Oh, my God!

939
01:03:26,114 --> 01:03:28,047
What the hell?

940
01:03:28,049 --> 01:03:29,451
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

941
01:03:31,353 --> 01:03:32,921
No one's gonna hurt the girl.

942
01:03:33,455 --> 01:03:36,088
Just don't kill me.

943
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:38,057
That would really complicate
the situation.

944
01:03:38,059 --> 01:03:40,860
I'm about five seconds
from complicating that wall

945
01:03:40,862 --> 01:03:42,229
with some ugly-ass
Skrull brains.

946
01:03:42,231 --> 01:03:43,996
TALOS: I'm sorry
I simmed your boss.

947
01:03:43,998 --> 01:03:47,767
But now I stand before you
as my true self.

948
01:03:47,769 --> 01:03:49,035
Without deception.

949
01:03:49,037 --> 01:03:50,239
And who is that out there?

950
01:03:51,139 --> 01:03:53,773
Okay, that's a fair point...

951
01:03:53,775 --> 01:03:55,375
but I'm sure
that you understand

952
01:03:55,377 --> 01:03:57,810
I had to take
some precautions.

953
01:03:57,812 --> 01:04:01,013
I saw you crush
20 of my best men

954
01:04:01,015 --> 01:04:02,181
with your hands bound.

955
01:04:02,183 --> 01:04:03,417
I just wanna talk.

956
01:04:03,419 --> 01:04:04,484
Last time we talked,

957
01:04:04,486 --> 01:04:05,918
I ended up
hanging from my ankles.

958
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:08,422
That was before I knew
who you were.

959
01:04:08,424 --> 01:04:11,726
Before I knew what made you
different from the others.

960
01:04:12,794 --> 01:04:14,994
I have an audio recording
from Pegasus...

961
01:04:14,996 --> 01:04:18,030
of your voice
from a plane crash

962
01:04:18,032 --> 01:04:19,499
six years ago...

963
01:04:19,501 --> 01:04:24,304
on a device I believe
you call a "black box."

964
01:04:24,306 --> 01:04:27,039
They told me it was
destroyed in the crash.

965
01:04:27,041 --> 01:04:28,242
How'd you get it?

966
01:04:28,244 --> 01:04:29,409
She don't understand.

967
01:04:29,411 --> 01:04:30,943
Young lady,
I have a special skill...

968
01:04:30,945 --> 01:04:32,379
that kind of allows me

969
01:04:32,381 --> 01:04:34,548
to get into places
I'm not supposed to be.

970
01:04:34,550 --> 01:04:35,915
Call me
"young lady" again...

971
01:04:35,917 --> 01:04:37,217
I'm gonna put my foot
in a place

972
01:04:37,219 --> 01:04:38,753
it's not supposed to be.

973
01:04:40,822 --> 01:04:43,091
Am I supposed to guess
where that is?

974
01:04:43,559 --> 01:04:44,625
BOTH: Your ass.

975
01:04:44,627 --> 01:04:47,527
Okay, I get it. We're all
a little on edge here.

976
01:04:47,529 --> 01:04:49,496
But, look,
I just need your help

977
01:04:49,498 --> 01:04:50,997
decoding some coordinates.

978
01:04:50,999 --> 01:04:52,999
If you'll sit down
and you'll listen to this...

979
01:04:53,001 --> 01:04:56,137
I assure you,
it'll be worth your while.

980
01:04:58,906 --> 01:05:01,075
Call your buddy back inside
and I'll listen.

981
01:05:01,577 --> 01:05:02,842
Deal.

Oh, my God!
Get that thing away.

984
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:07,314
How'd that get in here?

985
01:05:07,316 --> 01:05:08,417
Hmm?

01:05:09,917 --> 01:05:11,017
- The cat?
- (WHIMPERS)

This isn't what
you're afraid of, is it?

988
01:05:12,521 --> 01:05:13,821
That's not a cat.

989
01:05:14,856 --> 01:05:17,023
- That's a Flerken.
- FURY: A Flerken?

to prolong this conversation.

01:11:04,673 --> 01:11:06,675
YON-ROGG:
She absorbed its power.

1064
01:11:08,877 --> 01:11:10,712
She's coming with us.

1065
01:11:24,459 --> 01:11:27,194
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

1066
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:32,901
He lied to me.

1067
01:11:35,604 --> 01:11:37,704
Everything that I knew
was a lie.

1068
01:11:37,706 --> 01:11:40,440
Now, you understand.

1069
01:11:40,442 --> 01:11:42,976
What?
What do I understand now?

1070
01:11:42,978 --> 01:11:45,011
Yon-Rogg killed Mar-Vell.

1071
01:11:45,013 --> 01:11:46,314
He killed her...

1072
01:11:47,015 --> 01:11:48,915
'cause she found out
that she was

1073
01:11:48,917 --> 01:11:52,352
on the wrong side
of an unjust war.

1074
01:11:52,354 --> 01:11:53,853
VERS: No.

1075
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:56,289
Your people are terrorists.

1076
01:11:56,291 --> 01:11:57,824
They kill innocents.

1077
01:11:57,826 --> 01:11:59,759
I saw the ruins on Torfa.

1078
01:11:59,761 --> 01:12:03,463
Ruins that the Accusers
are responsible for.

1079
01:12:03,465 --> 01:12:07,534
My people lived as refugees
on Torfa.

1080
01:12:07,536 --> 01:12:10,637
Homeless, ever since
we resisted Kree rule...

1081
01:12:10,639 --> 01:12:12,772
and they destroyed
our planet.

1082
01:12:12,774 --> 01:12:16,509
And the handful of us
that are left

1083
01:12:16,511 --> 01:12:18,678
will be slaughtered next...

1084
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:22,684
unless you help me finish
what Mar-Vell started.

1085
01:12:23,919 --> 01:12:25,518
The core that she found

1086
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,287
would have powered
a light-speed ship...

1087
01:12:27,289 --> 01:12:29,055
capable of carrying us
to safety.

1088
01:12:29,057 --> 01:12:33,228
A new home where
the Kree can't reach us.

1089
01:12:34,629 --> 01:12:36,963
Lawson always told us
that our work at Pegasus

1090
01:12:36,965 --> 01:12:38,498
wasn't to fight wars...

1091
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:39,999
but to end them.

1092
01:12:40,001 --> 01:12:45,640
She wanted you to help us
find the core.

1093
01:12:46,608 --> 01:12:47,807
Well, I already destroyed it.

1094
01:12:47,809 --> 01:12:49,576
No, you destroyed
the engine.

1095
01:12:49,578 --> 01:12:52,712
The core that powered it
is in a remote location.

1096
01:12:52,714 --> 01:12:57,083
If you help us
decode those coordinates...

1097
01:12:57,085 --> 01:12:58,720
we can find it.

1098
01:13:00,555 --> 01:13:02,257
You'll use it
to destroy us.

1099
01:13:04,493 --> 01:13:07,462
(SIGHS)
We just want a home.

1100
01:13:11,666 --> 01:13:16,970
You and I lost everything
at the hands of the Kree.

1101
01:13:16,972 --> 01:13:18,972
Can't you see it now?

1102
01:13:18,974 --> 01:13:20,475
You're not one of them.

1103
01:13:23,512 --> 01:13:24,913
You don't know me.

1104
01:13:26,414 --> 01:13:28,784
You have no idea
who I am.

1105
01:13:30,886 --> 01:13:33,288
I don't even know
who I am!

1106
01:13:34,523 --> 01:13:36,758
You are Carol Danvers.

1107
01:13:37,959 --> 01:13:40,126
You are the woman
on that black box

1108
01:13:40,128 --> 01:13:42,764
risking her life
to do the right thing.

1109
01:13:44,599 --> 01:13:46,533
My best friend...

1110
01:13:46,535 --> 01:13:49,536
who supported me
as a mother and a pilot

1111
01:13:49,538 --> 01:13:51,604
when no one else did.

1112
01:13:51,606 --> 01:13:56,810
You are smart, and funny,
and a huge pain in the ass...

1113
01:13:56,812 --> 01:14:00,146
and you were the most
powerful person I knew...

1114
01:14:00,148 --> 01:14:03,418
way before you could
shoot fire from your fists.

1115
01:14:04,019 --> 01:14:05,554
You hear me?

1116
01:14:06,888 --> 01:14:08,723
Do you hear me?

1117
01:14:15,931 --> 01:14:17,933
Come here. Come here, girl.

1118
01:14:18,667 --> 01:14:20,001
I got you.

1119
01:14:24,406 --> 01:14:27,607
TALOS: <i>I know
I don't deserve your trust...</i>

1120
01:14:27,609 --> 01:14:29,843
but you were our only lead.

1121
01:14:29,845 --> 01:14:32,111
We discovered
that your energy signature

1122
01:14:32,113 --> 01:14:34,916
matched Mar-Vell's core.

1123
01:14:35,784 --> 01:14:37,652
Now we know why.

1124
01:14:39,521 --> 01:14:43,491
If only you knew
the importance of it to me.

1125
01:14:44,593 --> 01:14:46,426
I just need your help

1126
01:14:46,428 --> 01:14:50,630
decoding the coordinates
to Mar-Vell's lab.

1127
01:14:50,632 --> 01:14:53,800
Those weren't coordinates.
They're state vectors.

1128
01:14:53,802 --> 01:14:55,869
For orbital position
and velocity.

1129
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:57,704
You didn't find her lab
on Earth,

1130
01:14:57,706 --> 01:14:59,038
'cause it's not on Earth.

1131
01:14:59,040 --> 01:14:59,973
VERS: That was the location

1132
01:14:59,975 --> 01:15:01,574
on the date
of the crash six years ago.

1133
01:15:01,576 --> 01:15:02,942
If we track its course,

1134
01:15:02,944 --> 01:15:05,511
we'll find it in orbit
right now.

1135
01:15:05,513 --> 01:15:07,082
It's just basic physics.

1136
01:15:09,651 --> 01:15:10,651
In orbit?

1137
01:15:12,587 --> 01:15:14,187
Was that so difficult
to figure out?

1138
01:15:14,189 --> 01:15:17,123
I mean, you're
my science guy, right?

1139
01:15:17,125 --> 01:15:19,859
Yon-Rogg will catch up
to me soon.

1140
01:15:19,861 --> 01:15:22,695
We've got to get to the core
before he does.

1141
01:15:22,697 --> 01:15:24,564
Mmm. We're going
to space?

1142
01:15:24,566 --> 01:15:25,632
In what?

1143
01:15:25,634 --> 01:15:27,533
NOREX: A few tweaks
to your vessel should do it.

1144
01:15:27,535 --> 01:15:29,769
I can handle
the modifications.

1145
01:15:29,771 --> 01:15:31,506
Mmm. Your science guy.

1146
01:15:38,247 --> 01:15:39,881
VERS: Well, I could use
a copilot.

1147
01:15:41,149 --> 01:15:43,816
No. No, I can't.

1148
01:15:43,818 --> 01:15:45,852
I can't leave Monica.

1149
01:15:45,854 --> 01:15:49,155
Mom, it's okay. I can stay
with Gramma and Paw-paw.

1150
01:15:49,157 --> 01:15:51,524
There's no way I'm going,
baby. It's too dangerous.

1151
01:15:51,526 --> 01:15:53,593
Testing brand-new aerospace
tech is dangerous...

1152
01:15:53,595 --> 01:15:54,629
and you used to do that.

1153
01:15:56,265 --> 01:15:58,232
Your plan
is to leave the atmosphere

1154
01:15:58,234 --> 01:15:59,899
in a craft not designed
for the journey...

1155
01:15:59,901 --> 01:16:01,734
and you anticipate
hostile encounters...

1156
01:16:01,736 --> 01:16:02,835
with
a technologically-superior

1157
01:16:02,837 --> 01:16:03,838
foreign enemy.

1158
01:16:04,273 --> 01:16:05,838
Correct?

1159
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:06,906
That's what I'm saying.

1160
01:16:06,908 --> 01:16:08,174
- You have to go!
- Monica!

1161
01:16:08,176 --> 01:16:09,575
You have a chance
to fly the coolest mission

1162
01:16:09,577 --> 01:16:10,810
in the history
of missions...

1163
01:16:10,812 --> 01:16:12,679
and you're gonna give it up
to sit on the couch

1164
01:16:12,681 --> 01:16:13,882
and watch <i>Fresh Prince</i>
with me?

1165
01:16:14,683 --> 01:16:15,782
What?

1166
01:16:15,784 --> 01:16:16,983
I just think
you should consider...

1167
01:16:16,985 --> 01:16:20,222
what kind of example you're
setting for your daughter.

1168
01:16:22,757 --> 01:16:23,892
(CHUCKLES)

1169
01:16:27,896 --> 01:16:29,296
MARIA'S MOM:
What's going on around here?

1170
01:16:29,298 --> 01:16:30,563
MARIA: I know, I know.

1171
01:16:30,565 --> 01:16:31,967
I'll explain inside.
Thank you.

1172
01:16:36,972 --> 01:16:39,306
Your mom's lucky.

1173
01:16:39,308 --> 01:16:40,807
When they were
handing out kids,

1174
01:16:40,809 --> 01:16:43,009
they gave her
the toughest one.

1175
01:16:43,011 --> 01:16:44,012
Lieutenant Trouble.

1176
01:16:45,013 --> 01:16:46,648
You remembered.

1177
01:16:48,016 --> 01:16:49,484
Is that mine?

1178
01:16:50,185 --> 01:16:52,319
No, no.

1179
01:16:52,321 --> 01:16:55,188
You hang on to it
until I come back.

1180
01:16:55,190 --> 01:16:57,890
But there is something
that I need your help with.

1181
01:16:57,892 --> 01:17:00,760
I can't wear
these Kree colors anymore.

1182
01:17:00,762 --> 01:17:03,830
And since you are obviously
the only person around here

1183
01:17:03,832 --> 01:17:05,700
with any sense of style...

1184
01:17:06,935 --> 01:17:08,003
Hmm?

1185
01:17:10,105 --> 01:17:11,139
Whoa.

1186
01:17:13,775 --> 01:17:14,943
No.

1187
01:17:17,213 --> 01:17:18,214
Uh-uh.

1188
01:17:19,781 --> 01:17:21,315
Definitely not.

1189
01:17:21,317 --> 01:17:22,817
(LAUGHS)

1190
01:17:24,286 --> 01:17:26,721
Well, since we're
on the same team...

1191
01:17:37,799 --> 01:17:38,933
Hmm.

1192
01:17:40,236 --> 01:17:41,903
How do I look?

1193
01:17:45,341 --> 01:17:46,775
Fresh.

1194
01:17:48,009 --> 01:17:49,110

1196
01:18:06,694 --> 01:18:08,761
What took you so long?

1197
01:18:08,763 --> 01:18:11,731
I'm fine.
Thanks for asking.

1198
01:18:11,733 --> 01:18:14,167
- PRY46-B...
- No, no codes.

1199
01:18:14,169 --> 01:18:15,937
That system is fallible,
as we've learned.

1200
01:18:16,971 --> 01:18:19,306
Okay, then let's do this.

1201
01:18:19,308 --> 01:18:22,775
Who do I see when I commune
with the Supreme Intelligence?

1202
01:18:22,777 --> 01:18:25,678
The person you most admire
and respect, I'd guess.

1203
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:26,920
But you would never
tell me who.

1204
01:18:28,284 --> 01:18:31,684
And what is your
earliest memory of Hala?

1205
01:18:31,686 --> 01:18:33,220
The transfusion.

1206
01:18:33,222 --> 01:18:35,422
Blue blood
running through my veins.

1207
01:18:35,424 --> 01:18:36,624
Whose blood?

1208
01:18:39,228 --> 01:18:40,262
Hmm.

1210
01:18:47,735 --> 01:18:51,773
That's my blood that's
coursing through her veins.

1211
01:18:56,312 --> 01:18:57,910
What have you done with her?

1212
01:18:57,912 --> 01:18:59,881
You're too late.

1213
01:19:16,365 --> 01:19:17,399
She knows?

You know, you really shouldn't
have that thing on your lap.

Our little alliance with you
is tenuous at best.

yeah, I'm gonna keep
giving him

all the loves and hugs
that he needs, right?

1228
01:20:05,414 --> 01:20:07,214
Can I ask you something?

1229
01:20:07,216 --> 01:20:09,416
Do you just turn into
anything you want?

1230
01:20:09,418 --> 01:20:11,285
Ah, well,
I have to see it first.

1231
01:20:11,287 --> 01:20:12,919
Can you all do it?

1232
01:20:12,921 --> 01:20:14,854
Physiologically? Yeah.

1233

This came for you.

So, is it true?

1623
01:51:22,358 --> 01:51:23,890
That the Kree
burned your eye out...

1624
01:51:23,892 --> 01:51:27,160
because you refused
to give them the Tesseract?

1625
01:51:27,162 --> 01:51:31,097
I will neither confirm nor
deny the facts of that story.

1626
01:51:31,099 --> 01:51:32,167
Understood.
